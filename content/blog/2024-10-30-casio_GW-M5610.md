Three years ago, I bought a Casio GW-M5610 for 150 euros. I wanted a watch to reduce my phone usage and to break the habit of checking news feeds every time I grabbed my phone to check the time. In the same spirit, I wanted an alarm feature to replace my phone as a morning wake-up tool. I was looking for a rugged watch with an alarm feature that could withstand various outdoor activities.

The resin bracelet and case feel comfortable; it doesn’t have the weight of a metal strap and feels more natural for fighting the elements and erosion. It doesn’t retain sweat, nor does it develop an odor over time, as a leather strap might. Many elements of the design give it a rugged, almost "truck-like" feel, though some are unnecessary. Small cavities, for instance, tend to trap dust, mud, and sea salt.

I’m impressed by the crystal glass, which, even after three years, remains unscathed and, when clean, as clear as it was on the first day.

The watch’s screen periphery, however, is overloaded with information that would be better placed on the back of the watch. I realize this is likely intentional, designed to give the impression of a "technical" watch, but much of this information isn’t needed daily. I’m aware it’s water-resistant to 20 bars, as I checked the specifications before purchasing and read the manual—there’s no need to display this on the front. The same goes for the “Tough Solar” and “G-SHOCK PROTECTION” labels, which the owner only needs to know once.

Features are all I needed, nothing more, nothing less.
