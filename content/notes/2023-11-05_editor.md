The first code editor I was introduced to was Emacs, during my
first progamming lessons at my engineering school, I find the choice of
our teachers quite comprehensive now: It is a powerful tool with a graphical
interface that did not afraid us when discovering the first time a shell.
The integration with Ocaml tooling was also top notch.
Then I was appealed by the design of Sublime text, it feels nice and I was
only developing few projects during the academic year.

I discovered Vim at my second internship. My mentor witnessing my interest 
for this editor, sat next to me one afternoon, dicting me commands while
navigating through the company codebase and explaining me the basics
of conflict resolution on vim.
